# DataMiningPhase3
Apply data mining algorithms to solve the defined problem and evaluate model performance.

This code accomplished the following:

Model Selection: Based on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering), choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., decision tree, k-NN, etc.).
Model Training: Split the dataset into training and test sets, train the model, and make predictions.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), R-squared, or RMSE (for regression).
Submission: Submit the model evaluation results, including visualization
